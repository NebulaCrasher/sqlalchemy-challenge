## Hawaii Precipitation
Wanted to check out Hawaii's general climate and looked at annual precipitation date gathered by 9 distinct stations around the state of Hawaii. Average rainfall
was about .16 inches. The precipitation graph the instructions wanted me to produce seemed very off to me and I felt like a scatter plot would be a better way
to describe the data so instead a scatter plot was used.
 ## Station Analysis
 Connected to the SQL database and query'd how many distinct stations there were. Took the station with that had the most measurements as the reference station.
 Found out from this station that the average temperature of Hawaii is about 71.66 degrees Fahrenheit which is near perfect weather. What a great vacation this will be!
